On March 19th primary-election voters in Chicago were asked to vote on a ballot measure that would have raised the transfer tax on properties worth over $1m so as to generate money to pay for homelessness relief. The measure was backed by the city’s entire progressive establishment. Its opponents, mostly from the real-estate industry, did not even bother to organise a rival event. And yet by 9pm on election night, “No” was leading by around eight percentage points. “Let’s just pretend,” said Myron Byrd, from the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless, an activist group, mournfully, before he belted out a song he had wanted to perform to celebrate victory. The party ended with chants of “we will not give up”, long after most attendees gave up and left.</p><p>The defeat of the “Bring Chicago Home” measure was crushing for Chicago’s mayor, Brandon Johnson, who had heavily promoted it. But it is perhaps an even bigger defeat for his former employer, the Chicago Teachers Union (<small>ctu</small>), which put $400,000 and the organising work of its 28,000 members into getting a Yes vote. In the past decade or so, the union has become one of the most powerful in the country by adopting a model of radical left-wing political organising. From 2022 to the end of last year it put $2.3m into Mr Johnson’s campaign fund. Its support helped elevate Mr Johnson, previously an unknown county commissioner, into office. This year it hopes to reap the spoils—the teachers’ contract is up for renewal. But is the union overreaching?</p><p>The <small>ctu</small>’s transformation began over a decade ago, when Rahm Emanuel was mayor. On coming into office and discovering a huge hole in the teachers’ pension scheme, Mr Emanuel cancelled a pay rise and took a hardline approach to negotiation. In 2012 incensed teachers went on strike for the first time in 25 years. In 2013 he then began a deeply controversial programme to close 50 of the city’s public schools, further invigorating the union’s organising efforts. After another strike in 2019, by last year it had developed the confidence to help push out Mr Emanuel’s successor, Lori Lightfoot.</p><p>With Mr Johnson in office, the <small>ctu</small> is in an enviable position. Instead of dealing with somebody like Ms Lightfoot or Mr Emanuel, this year teachers will negotiate with their own union’s former lobbyist. They expect a payoff. In early March the Illinois Policy Institute (<small>IPI</small>), a right-leaning think-tank, leaked the union’s early negotiating proposals. Among the suggestions were that teachers ought to get “cost of living” pay increases of 9% a year, subsidised housing, more generous pensions, and health insurance with smaller copays. The union also wants every school in the city to be guaranteed a librarian and more staff of all sorts to be hired. “They can demand almost anything under the sun,” says Austin Berg, of the <small>IPI</small>.</p><h2>Johnson’s choice</h2><p>The union sees this as only what it is due. At its head is Stacy Davis Gates, a former history teacher who says she was radicalised by school closures. Ms Davis Gates takes a no-compromise approach to politics. In a speech to bigwigs at the City Club on March 5th she told journalists wondering about how the district would pay for her union’s proposals to “stop asking that question”. She also discussed the toll it took on her mental health to have it revealed she sends her teenage son to a private Catholic school, rather than a public one. At the end of the speech she finally offered a figure for the cost of her proposals: “$50bn and three cents”.</p><p>The trouble is there is no more money. This year the budget amounts to $29,000 per pupil. Such spending is possible only thanks to a huge slug of federal covid-relief funding. By 2026 the school district projects it will have a deficit of $691m even before the costs of a new contract. It cannot raise its property tax any faster. A state bailout is unlikely, says Hal Woods of Kids First Chicago, a charity. That leaves only the equally cash-strapped city. Even some once sympathetic to the <small>ctu</small> are nervous. “They are trying to solve the bad policy decisions of the past two or three decades by just throwing money at it,” says Stephanie Farmer, an academic at Roosevelt University. “It makes me very disappointed.”</p><p>What Chicago’s schools actually need is reform. As things are, even large sums of money do not go especially far. One of the biggest problems is that there are simply too many schools. Over the past two decades enrolment has shrunk by over a quarter, even as new charter schools opened. Over a third of the city’s schools are operating at below 50% capacity. A few high schools have less than 10% of the number of students they were built for. Oversized schools cost huge sums to run even as they have to skimp on services (like librarians). Closing them would be fiercely unpopular, but the <small>ctu</small>’s solution in essence amounts to staffing them all as though they are full.</p><p>In the negotiations Mr Johnson has a choice. If he simply pays up, he will have to starve the rest of the city’s services to pay for it. The alternative is defying those who put him into office. And yet in a way, the results of the Bring Chicago Home ballot measure could make that easier.  In the mayoral race last year, when asked about how he would negotiate with the teachers, Mr Johnson replied, “who better to deliver bad news to friends than a friend?” That becomes a lot easier if your friend suddenly seems a lot less popular. <span>■</span></p><p><i>Stay on top of American politics with <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/newsletters/us-in-brief\">The <small>US </small>in brief</a>, our daily newsletter with fast analysis of the most important electoral stories, and <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/newsletters/checks-and-balance\">Checks and Balance</a>, a weekly note from our Lexington columnist that examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters.</i></p></div><h3>Explore more</h3><nav><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/topics/united-states\"><span>United States</span></a></nav><p>This article appeared in the United States section of the print edition under the headline \"Militant tendency\"</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20240323_DE_EU.jpg\"></figure><h3>From the March 23rd 2024 edition</h3><p>Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents</p><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/2024-03-23\"><span>Explore the edition</span></a><a href=\"https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Is%20the%20most%20powerful%20teachers%20union%20in%20America%20overreaching%3F&amp;publicationDate=2024-03-21&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fibc0eav182hkvg4c5s6cshls2hjaf8gp&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE\"><span>Reuse this content</span></a></div>",

More recently, the <small>FDA</small> widened the window during which the medicine may be used and eased dispensing requirements. But on March 26th the Supreme Court will consider whether these loosened regulations should be tightened back up.</p><p><i><small>FDA</small> v Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine</i> began as an assault on the <small>FDA</small>’s original approval of mifepristone. In April 2023 the district-court judge in Texas who heard the case invalidated the authorisation from 2000 and each of the subsequent liberalisations. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals kept mifepristone on the shelves when it pared back this extraordinary ruling last August. But the appeals court agreed that the 2016 and 2021 changes—allowing the drug to be used through ten weeks of pregnancy (up from seven) and to be sent to women by post with a remote prescription—had to go.</p><p>The plaintiffs will be represented at the Supreme Court by Erin Hawley, wife of Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri. They contend that the <small>FDA</small> violated the Administrative Procedure Act, a law governing how agencies operate, when it expanded access to the purportedly “high risk” drug in 2016 and 2021. The changes in 2016 followed a “piecemeal analysis” of insufficient data, the Alliance writes, and the action of 2021 relied on “unreliable” information. Lifting “long-existing and common-sense safety standards” was “arbitrary and capricious” and thus “unreasonable”. </p><p>The federal government and Danco, which markets mifepristone as Mifeprex, paint the <small>FDA</small>’s decisions in a rosier light. The move in 2016 was based on “an enormous and highly reliable data set”, the government says. The decision to allow pills-by-post in 2021 was informed by “extensive published literature”, plus more than two decades of women safely using mifepristone. Emergencies arise in at most 0.7% of cases, making the medicine safer than Viagra or penicillin.</p><p>The two sides will surely debate the wisdom of the <small>FDA</small>’s moves in next week’s oral argument. But the question of standing could dominate the conversation: whether the challengers have the legal right to bring the case. The Supreme Court has held that fierce opposition to a policy is no grounds to sue the government. Litigants must show they have suffered a “concrete injury” with a clear causal link.</p><p>The plaintiffs advance a host of arguments to claim standing. Their main contention is reminiscent of a Rube Goldberg machine: pro-life doctors could be forced to violate their conscience if no one else is available to complete terminations for women rushed to the emergency room after complications from a medical abortion prescribed elsewhere. This “long chain of contingencies” stemming from “an exceedingly rare serious adverse event” is purely speculative, the government argues: the plaintiffs have not named “even a single doctor among their thousands of members who has ever been required to perform an abortion in the decades mifepristone has been on the market”.</p><p>The Supreme Court arguably bent the rules of standing last year in a case that dashed President Joe Biden’s plan to cancel student loans. But the winding argument from mifepristone’s foes<i>—</i>and the legal adventurism of the lower courts—may stretch too far even for the five justices who dispatched<i> Roe v Wade </i>in 2022.<span>■</span></p><p><i>Stay on top of American politics with <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/newsletters/us-in-brief\">The <small>US </small>in brief</a>, our daily newsletter with fast analysis of the most important electoral stories, and <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/newsletters/checks-and-balance\">Checks and Balance</a>, a weekly note from our Lexington columnist that examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters.</i></p></div><h3>Explore more</h3><nav><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/topics/united-states\"><span>United States</span></a></nav><p>This article appeared in the United States section of the print edition under the headline \"Miffy-ed\"</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20240323_DE_EU.jpg\"></figure><h3>From the March 23rd 2024 edition</h3><p>Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents</p><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/2024-03-23\"><span>Explore the edition</span></a><a href=\"https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=The%20Supreme%20Court%20hears%20its%20first%20abortion%20case%20since%20ending%20Roe&amp;publicationDate=2024-03-21&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fdr3qpn6tmkerl0hefi1in0u06qdvfgq0&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE\"><span>Reuse this content</span></a></div>",

On Reddit and Rumble (a kind of far-right YouTube) they pump up their man Donald Trump and his social-media company, Truth Social, which they pray will soon go public via a <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/04/12/what-is-a-spac\">special-purpose acquisition company</a> (<small>SPAC</small>). Together they pore over its latest filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (<small>SEC</small>), then they read a Bible verse or two. One Old Testament proverb—“Buy the truth and do not sell it”—is almost too apt. “That’s what we’re doing here, folks,” says Chad Nedohin, a hype-man on Rumble. “Literally, as a team of investors, we have bought into truth and we are never selling because we are diamond-handed <small>HODL</small>ers”. That is crypto-speak for “hold on for dear life”.</p><p>Faith is a prerequisite for this merry band of meme-stock traders. Truth Social’s path to the public markets has been long and fraught, dogged by an <small>SEC</small> probe, lawsuits by disgruntled former employees and a cash crunch. At last a flotation looks imminent. On March 22nd investors in a <small>SPAC</small>—a listed pot of capital—called <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/united-states/2021/12/11/donald-trumps-media-spac-is-the-zeitgeist-wrapped-in-a-complex-financial-instrument\">Digital World Acquisition Corp</a> (<small>DWAC</small>) will vote on whether to merge with Truth Social’s parent company, Trump Media &amp; Technology Group.

Trump Media is running on fumes: in the first three quarters of last year it lost $49m and had just $1.8m cash on hand as of September. Through the merger it will raise about $240m, estimates Michael Ohlrogge of New York University School of Law. At <small>DWAC</small>’s current share price the new entity will have a market capitalisation of $6.3bn. As with other meme stocks, that makes no economic sense. The firm has reported 8.9m sign-ups for Truth Social but prefers not to disclose how many are active daily. “Focusing on these <small>KPI</small>s might not align with the best interests” of Trump Media, says its prospectus.</p><p>Mr Trump will own a stake worth $4.1bn. But a six-month lock-up, during which he cannot sell, makes paper gains of little use in his present liquidity crunch. In February Mr Trump was fined nearly half a billion dollars for fraud at his <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/02/17/the-consequences-of-donald-trumps-huge-fine-for-fraud\">property business</a>; by March 25th he must secure a bond for that amount while he appeals against the judgment.</p><p>That is proving tricky: about 30 bond companies have turned him down so far because he lacks enough cash to put up as collateral. He has asked an appeals court to reduce the bond. If it refuses he will have to sell assets or ask a rich supporter to bail him out. Failing that Letitia James, the prosecutor who brought the case, could freeze his bank accounts or seize some of his property. She likes to say that she can see 40 Wall Street, one of Mr Trump’s towers, from her office.</p><p>As for <small>DJT</small>, economic reality should sink in eventually. If and when Mr Trump liquidates his holdings the share price will drop. Since the beginning of 2019 nine out of ten <small>SPAC</small>s have lost value after combining with their target company, notes Michael Klausner of Stanford Law School. On average the share prices of post-merger <small>SPAC</small>s have declined by 60%. Target companies got a good deal in these mergers while <small>SPAC</small> shareholders who stuck through the listing—mostly unsophisticated retail investors—took a bath.</p><p>The <small>DJT</small> crowd hears the critics; it just thinks they are wrong. Back in 2022, when the <small>SEC</small> was investigating the deal, Mr Nedohin, the Rumble hype-man, insisted that Trump Media was not a Ponzi scheme. “This is different,” he assured his excitable followers. “We are helping promote a company that has the potential to be a trillion dollars easily…It will be paying out!” <span>■</span></p><p><i>Stay on top of American politics with <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/newsletters/us-in-brief\">The <small>US </small>in brief</a>, our daily newsletter with fast analysis of the most important electoral stories, and <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/newsletters/checks-and-balance\">Checks and Balance</a>, a weekly note from our Lexington columnist that examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters.</i></p></div><h3>Explore more</h3><p>This article appeared in the United States section of the print edition under the headline \"That’s DWAC\"</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20240323_DE_EU.jpg\"></figure><h3>From the March 23rd 2024 edition</h3><p>Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents</p><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/2024-03-23\"><span>Explore the edition</span></a><a href=\"https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Donald%20Trump%20tries%20his%20hand%20with%20meme-stocks&amp;publicationDate=2024-03-20&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2F4q3r16c8ld73an9ecfi059dv0g59j3hl&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE\"><span>Reuse this content</span></a></div>",

That year, Republicans passed <small>SB</small>1070, known as the “show me your papers” law, which required state police to ask individuals they suspected of being undocumented to provide proof of their status. Joe Arpaio, the publicity-minded sheriff in Arizona’s most populous county, recruited right-leaning Hollywood actors to a “posse” he formed to track down illegal migrants. Although the Supreme Court struck down most of <small>SB</small>1070’s provisions and voters ousted Mr Arpaio in 2016, “those scars aren’t going away,” says Mr Gallego, now a congressman running for an open Senate seat. He says the legacy of Latino activism from the Arpaio era may explain why, in 2020, Arizona Latinos voted for Joe Biden in higher numbers than Latinos nationally did, helping to deliver Mr Biden a narrow 10,000-vote victory in the state. </body-text> <body-text>Yet <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/interactive/us-2024-election/trump-biden-polls/\">Donald Trump</a> is once again testing Democrats’ assumptions. He gained some 90,000 Latino voters in Arizona between 2016 and 2020 despite having pardoned Mr Arpaio for a criminal-contempt conviction, calling him an “American patriot” who “kept Arizona safe”. And if current polling is anything to go by, Mr Trump looks set to cut further into Mr Biden’s margins with Latino voters come November. </body-text>   <h1>Vote margin, percentage points</h1>    <text>40</text>  <text>20</text>  <text>0</text>  <text>20</text>  <text>40</text>   <text>2000</text>   <text>2004</text>   <text>2008</text>   <text>2012</text>   <text>2016</text>   <text>2020</text>   <text>← Dem\n          </text><text>Rep →</text><text>National</text>  <p>The Democrats have won the  <span>national popular vote</span> in five of the past six elections.

In 2020 Donald Trump ate into the Democrats’ advantage.</p> <p>Mr Trump’s standing in polls now, more than seven months before the election, suggests he could win over even more Hispanic voters than he did in 2020.</p> <p>However, <span>Hispanic voters in Arizona</span> were less likely to swing to Mr Trump in 2020 than those nationally, helping to deliver Mr Biden a narrow victory in the state. </p><p>Sources: Catalist; Federal Election Commission; Pew Research Centre; YouGov</p>   <body-text>The Latino electorate is growing unusually fast and a majority still prefers Democrats. Of the six swing states likely to decide the presidential election in November (the other five being Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin), Arizona has the largest share of Latino voters. Mr Trump is clearly gaining popularity among Hispanics. However, current polling suggests that Latino voters still prefer Democrats overall, just by a smaller margin than in the past—meaning that it is Mr Biden who will benefit from the growth in Latino voters. The outcome in Arizona will depend largely on the race between these two trends. </body-text>  <body-text>The Arizona contest reflects fluidity in the national Latino vote. The group has never constituted a political monolith. It includes both Florida’s right-leaning refugees from Cuba’s socialist dictatorship and California’s proud leftist heirs to Chicano activism. Yet because, on average, Latino voters came to America more recently than non-Hispanic white and black Americans, they are less likely to have inherited a strong party affiliation from their parents or grandparents. They also “are more likely to hold what political scientists call cross-cutting identities”, or traits more commonly found among people outside one’s political tribe, says Samara Klar, a political scientist at the University of Arizona in Tucson. An evangelical Democrat might sound like an oxymoron but half of evangelical Latinos say the Democratic Party represents their interests. Because of cross-cutting identities, “Latino voters know a lot more people from the other party and they’re less hostile” towards them, notes Dr Klar. </body-text> <body-text>Latinos also tend to have less extreme views. Compared with white Americans, they are less likely to identify as very conservative or very liberal. In a recent YouGov/<i>The Economist</i> poll one in seven said they do not know where they fall on the political spectrum, three times the number of white Americans who said the same. </body-text> <body-text>Given these attributes, it should be little surprise that although Latinos as a whole lean Democratic, millions have voted for Republican candidates. Exit polls suggest that as far back as 1984 Ronald Reagan won some 37% of the Latino vote. By 2004 George W. Bush’s approximate 40% share was a high-water mark that even Mr Trump has yet to achieve. </body-text>  <body-text>Democrats have assumed at their peril that Latinos are a natural constituency and share many of the party’s (increasingly) progressive preferences. “Latinos are not the black vote and Democrats just don’t understand that,” says Mike Madrid, a veteran Republican strategist. Yet Republicans have at times fallen into the same trap, assuming that Latinos leaned so Democratic that courting them was futile. “There were no Latino organisers in the Republican Party for 30 years,” adds Mr Madrid. </body-text> <body-text>That has changed. In 2020 Republicans made gains with Latinos across the board. Voter profiles from Catalist, a political-data firm that helps Democrats, show that although Democrats won Latinos outright, Republicans increased their vote share among all subgroups of Latino voters. Their strides were especially large with non-college-educated Latinos. They swung 11 percentage points to the right between 2016 and 2020. Republicans also gained six points among college-educated Latinos. And while Mr Trump did not generally make notable gains among young voters between 2016 and 2020, young Latinos lurched to the right. Mr Trump’s share of votes from 18- to 29-year-old Latinos increased from 21% to 31%. </body-text> <body-text>Some of this Republican momentum might be a reversion to the mean. Latino support for Barack Obama, the first minority nominee, and Hillary Clinton, the first female one, may have been unusually strong. Without Mrs Clinton to inspire them, Latinas swung towards Mr Trump by 12 percentage points in 2020. But why else did Republican gains materialise in such a pronounced way in 2020? </body-text> <body-text>Covid may have been a factor. The disease disproportionately killed Latinos and strained their incomes. Some 24% of Latinos were employed as low-income front-line workers, more than any other race or ethnicity. About one in four new businesses are Hispanic-owned. So although Democrats’ focus on lockdowns and containing the disease may have saved many Latinos’ lives, it was perceived as threatening their livelihoods. Meanwhile, Mr Trump and Republican governors across the country advocated for fewer restrictions and a swift return to normal. According to a report by Equis Research, an outfit that studies Latino political behaviour, “Latino voters saw the 2020 election as a referendum on the economy…in a way they hadn’t in 2016.” </body-text> <body-text>About 85% of Arizona’s Latino voters trace their origins to Mexico, a cohort whose views typically track Latino national averages. Yet whereas Democrats’ lead over Republicans among Latinos shrank by 16 points nationally in 2020, in Arizona their lead narrowed by only 9.6 points. Had Mr Trump performed among Arizona Latinos as he did nationally he would have won the state. His prospects have improved since then. Even after accounting for Democrats’ strength in Arizona, current polling suggests Mr Biden’s chances of winning the state in November are on a knife’s edge. </body-text> <body-text>Holding constant the advantage Democrats had among Latinos in Arizona in 2020, Mr Biden is currently up by 17 percentage points among Latinos in the state, an 8.4-point shift to the right. An equivalent erosion in support would have cost Mr Biden 50,000 votes in 2020, enough for him to lose the state. Yet Republicans appear poorly positioned to seize upon their gains as the 2024 general-election campaign gets under way. Four years ago the Republican National Committee (<small>RNC</small>) invested early and heavily to win over Latino voters. This year the <small>RNC</small> is starved for cash. It has just $8m on hand compared with $77m at this point in 2020. And the Arizona Republican Party has been hobbled by dysfunction and factional disputes. All this bodes ill because campaign pros say the formula for winning an election that requires a surge in turnout is simple: spend money and reach out to voters early and often. </body-text> <body-text>Mr Biden could still win the White House while losing Arizona. Assuming that the forecasts of a tight race prove accurate, and that Mr Biden holds on to Pennsylvania and Michigan, which are his strongest prospects among the half-dozen swing states, he would need to win at least one more of them. But Mr Biden’s loosening grip on the Latino vote— which is a significant factor in other closely contested states, particularly Nevada—is hardly encouraging. </body-text> <body-text>Democrats are betting that the electoral maths will continue to favour them in Arizona because the Latino electorate will continue to grow. (They also expect Mr Biden’s standing with voters to improve by November.) The number of Latinos voting in Arizona has in fact increased steadily over the past two decades. This year alone there will be 150,000 newly eligible Latino voters in the state. And Arizona Latinos seem particularly motivated. In 2020 a striking 67% of eligible Latino voters in Arizona went to the polls, compared with 54% nationally (which was the lowest of all major racial and ethnic groups). If Latino turnout again reaches 67% in November, that would mean that Democrats could lose nearly four points from their Arizona margins over Republicans in 2020 and still net just as many votes. </body-text>  <body-text>Yet it is not a sure bet that Latinos will comprise a larger share of the electorate in 2024. Mr Biden and Mr Trump are both deeply unpopular candidates. Latinos are especially lukewarm on both. In national-level polling from YouGov/<i>The Economist</i> Hispanic respondents are roughly twice as likely as white ones to say that neither candidate would do a good job handling the issues they prioritise: <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/03/14/americas-extraordinary-economy-keeps-defying-the-pessimists\">the economy</a>, inflation, health care and immigration. Among those who select a candidate, Mr Biden is viewed as stronger on health care while Mr Trump is seen as stronger on immigration. </body-text> <body-text>Latino attitudes about immigration do not align neatly with the policies of either major party. Polling from Unidos, a lobbying group, found that roughly 83% of the Latinos they surveyed in Arizona in November 2023 supported a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, long a Democratic goal. Yet in that same survey 63% favoured <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/03/07/can-joe-biden-bring-order-to-the-southern-border-without-congress\">securing the border</a>, the signature cause of Republicans. “Republicans only want border security. They don’t want a pathway to citizenship…they just want moats and crocodiles and hot oil on the border,” argues Mr Madrid. And Democrats are often seen as having prioritised everything but a secure border. Between July and October of 2023 Arizona had more migrant encounters on its southern border than any other state and the crisis has persisted this year. Republicans will be hoping that Democrats bear the brunt of the political fallout. </body-text> <body-text>Economic issues may also hurt Mr Biden. Until 2019 housing in the Phoenix metropolitan area, where two-thirds of the state’s population lives, was cheaper than the nationwide average. Residents there now shell out 12% more than average. Inflation also spiked higher in Phoenix during 2022 than in any other city, although it has since fallen below the national average. In November 2023 some 59% of Latinos in the state said inflation was one of their most pressing concerns. That cannot be helping Mr Biden’s standing. </body-text> <body-text>These perceptions may yet change as inflation softens. But views on access to <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/03/19/fewer-states-allow-abortions-yet-american-women-are-having-more\">abortion</a> tend to be more fixed, and here Democrats retain an advantage. Some 65% of Arizona Latinos think that, no matter their personal views, it is wrong to make abortion illegal. In the aftermath of the <i>Dobbs</i> decision in 2022, which overturned the constitutional right to abortion, a surge of women registered to vote in Arizona. In November Arizonans may vote on a referendum that would protect a woman’s right to an abortion through viability, or about 24 weeks of pregnancy. That could increase Democrat-leaning turnout. </body-text> <body-text>Political campaigns come and go, but Democrats’ outreach to Latinos is maintained during off-cycle years with a vast network of grassroots Latino organisations that hew progressive. “This does not exist on the Republican side of the equation,” laments Helder Toste, a former field director at the Republican National Senatorial Committee. </body-text> <body-text>These dynamics will affect more than just the presidential ticket. They may well help decide which party controls the House and the Senate. Mr Gallego, who currently represents parts of Phoenix in the House of Representatives, will probably do battle with Kari Lake, a Trump acolyte and election-denier, for Kyrsten Sinema’s open Senate seat. The state also has two competitive House races. One features an incumbent and rising star, Juan Ciscomani, a Mexican-born Republican who gave the party’s Spanish-language response to Joe Biden’s state-of-the-union speech in 2023. </body-text> <body-text>The election is still more than seven months away and many Latino voters have not tuned in yet. According to polling from YouGov/<i>The Economist</i>, 38% of Hispanic respondents, compared with 23% of white respondents, say they are paying little or no attention to the 2024 presidential campaigns. In the autumn, when more Latino voters take note, they are likely to be bombarded with messages that the fate of the nation lies in their hands. In Arizona at least, the adverts will not be all exaggeration. <span>■</span> </body-text> <hr><div>Sources: YouGov; Catalist; Redistricting Data Hub; US Census Bureau; OpenStreetMap; Pew Research Centre; Federal Election Commission; All About Redistricting; ArcGIS; <i>The Economist</i></div> </main>\n",

For years this has been the neighbourhood’s go-to place for <small>STI</small> testing and <small>HIV</small> treatment. Joaquin Aracena, from the Bureau of Public Health Clinics, proudly shows its newest addition: the <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/11/16/some-progressives-are-arguing-for-a-religious-right-to-abortion\">reproductive-health</a> wing. With freshly painted white walls and pastel-green doors, it is distinctly less institutional-looking than the rest of the clinic.</p><p>“Once they did [away with] <i>Roe v Wade</i> I was able to get this space,” he says. The clinic now offers walk-in medication abortions free to all. Word is clearly spreading. Last year it provided just over 700 <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/10/06/abortion-bans-in-america-are-corroding-some-doctors-souls\">abortions;</a> in January it was 100, and this morning the two nurse practitioners have already sent four women home with a non-transparent bag containing the pills they need to terminate their pregnancies.</p><p>This is one of the more unexpected results of the Supreme Court’s decision in 2022 to overturn <i>Roe</i>, a ruling that returned the issue of abortion to states and triggered bans. That gave the city’s government new energy to take a more active role in co-ordinating access to abortion, says the city’s health commissioner, Ashwin Vasan. This included putting up billboards in Arizona and Texas and opening clinics in underserved pockets of the city. Less than nine months after <i>Dobbs v Jackson</i>, the ruling that overturned <i>Roe, </i>the Jamaica clinic’s abortion service was up and running.</p><p>Many hurdles—practical, financial, social—can stand in a woman’s way, even where abortion is legal. One consequence of <i>Dobbs</i>  is improved access in states with a supportive approach to abortion.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_EPM969.png\"><figcaption><span>Map: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure><p>New data from the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-abortion-rights research group, estimate that over 1m abortions were performed in America in 2023—a rise of 10% compared with 2020 and the highest number in over a decade. This is astonishing, given that the procedure is now banned in 14 states and has become restricted in several more. States bordering those with bans had the steepest rises: up by 72% in Illinois since 2020, 76% in Virginia and 257% in New Mexico.</p><p>Last year more than 160,000 women—over 400 a day—crossed state borders to terminate pregnancies, versus 81,100 in 2020 (albeit a covid-19 year). More surprising is the growth among residents of abortion-supporting states. In California locals had an estimated 21,470 more abortions in 2023 than in 2020 (accounting for 88% of the state’s increase) and in New York they had 20,460 more (97%). Overall, in states without bans, over half of the rise was the result of locals having more abortions.</p><p>Efforts to improve access in such states may help explain this growth.  Several states have reduced out-of-pocket spending for patients. Illinois, New Mexico and New York have increased their Medicaid reimbursement rates for first- and second-trimester abortion procedures by more than 200%, according to forthcoming analysis by <small>KFF</small>, a health-research group. In ten states health insurers are now required to cover abortion, up from six before <i>Dobbs</i>.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_USC860.png\"><figcaption><span>Map: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nothing has helped expand access as much as abortion pills, which now account for 63% of abortions in America, up from 45% in 2019 (see chart). Medication abortions are cheaper than procedural ones, and easier for clinics to provide and (especially in rural areas) for patients to receive. They are effective in the first trimester, when 94% of abortions happen. Telehealth experiments during the pandemic helped fuel the expansion, as did a loosening of regulations on their use and distribution. Next week the <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/03/21/the-supreme-court-hears-its-first-abortion-case-since-ending-roe\">Supreme Court</a> will consider whether the rules should be tightened again.</p><p>Whereas in 2020 only 7% of providers offered abortions via telemedicine, by 2022 that had increased to 31%. Mai Fleming from Hey Jane, a virtual-only abortion provider, says she can offer medication abortions at “a fraction” of the cost of bricks-and-mortar clinics. She has seen particularly large increases in orders from states that border restrictive states, such as Colorado, Illinois and New Mexico.</p><p>Abortion havens have also solidified legal protections, both for patients (eg, data privacy) and providers (eg, malpractice insurance). Some have amended state constitutions to include a right to abortion. Six states now have telemedicine shield laws that protect licensed practitioners from prosecution if they prescribe and send pills to patients in states that ban abortion.</p><p>Alternative explanations for the nationwide rise in abortions, beyond the spread of pills and efforts to lower barriers, do not seem to hold water. It does not, for example, appear to stem from a spike in unplanned pregnancies, which—a short bump during the covid pandemic excepted—show little sign of change since <i>Dobbs</i>. </p><p>It would be wrong to conclude that all is fine in post-<i>Roe</i> America. Abortion pills may be a godsend for early unplanned pregnancies, but for women in states with bans who need an abortion later—often due to fetal abnormalities detected at the 20-week scan—getting an abortion is harder than it has been for decades.<span>■</span></p><p><i><b>Correction (March 19th 2024)</b>: An earlier version of this article misstated the number of women who crossed state borders to terminate pregnancies in 2020.
