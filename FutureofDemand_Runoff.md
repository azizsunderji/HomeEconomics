#### What drives demand: demographics

- Even if business cycles dictate short run price moves, over the long run demographics is the most important driver of demand for homes 

*Chart: Millennials Bump Chart*

- 4 Ds (divorce, death, diapers, downsizing)
- Home prices / sales track demographics not business cycles
- Household formation is hard to estimate, since it's endogenous (if home prices are higher, fewer people form new households)

*Chart: Historical household formation, Business cycles, and Home prices or sales*
*Chart: Population by age, historically and future
*

- Millennials are a bigger generation than Boomers, but may demand less home ownership because their headship rates are lower. 
- Household formation should remain high for another ~5 years, before declining
- This is a function of both Boomers and Millennials demanding housing
- Immigration will also add to demand

*Chart: household formation forecast*

- what drives household formation?
- >a. number of people in that age group
b. proportion of those that form their own households
c. proportion of households that are owners
e. proportion that are first time buyers (net demand)

#### Impact on housing industry

- The net change in households impacts overall housing demand—but that could be owned homes or rentals
- We can tease out the specific impact on owned homes by looking at % ownership (the rest of the growth is apartment demand)

- home prices not sensitive to population growth as much as GDP (prices needn't fall)
- the pace of new owners is being dampened by slowing population growth
- on top of this, if the headship rate is steady at low current low levels, and homeownership rate declines because of weak affordability, the number of new owners falls even more
- NB: you can stress test all of this, but the bedrock is falling population growth
- It's reasonable to imagine ownership rates for older groups will decline—as Boomers are replaced by GFC-scarred people, who have had lower HO rates than prior generations at the same age (ie, a series of lines, each one tracking HO% by age, for each generation, would show successively lower lines)—ie, the GFC will be felt even in 2040!
- The growth and timing of demand for home ownership is a function of 3 factors: (1) the change in population overall, (2) the distribution of the population change by age group (and, by race), (3) the change in the characteristics of those groups over time (headship rate, ownership rate)
- Demand will still grow because the population is growing, and most of the growth will be in older groups, where base rates of headship and ownership are higher than for younger people
- But the pace of formation will slow, because Boomers are already in the high headship/ownership category, and the number of people replacing them will be smaller (population effect), and have historically had lower head/ownership rates (Gen X, scarred by the GFC)
- But arent't Millennials an even bigger generation? Why doesnt their aging into higher headship/ownership age categories boost the number of owners? (is it because )
- Pop growth falling. headship and homeownership falling. Effect on overall owners is muted by population aging.

### Notes


- You'd think that—with the population growth slowing and aging—housing demand would slow from its recent, white-hot pace
- But in fact there are 3 reasons demand will remain robust for a while longer:
> a. Immigration will compensate for some decline in natural growth
> b. Aging Americans demand more, not less, housing than younger people (and because of aging in place, demanding more housing than they have historically)
> c.  There is a swell of younger people aging into a key home buying age
- A rising % of the growth will come from immigration rather than natural population growth
- The marginal demand for housing will come from 2 segments of the population: Boomers and young Millennials
- This forecast is a function of the drivers of demand for each age cohort:
>a. number of people in that age group
b. proportion of those that form their own households
c. proportion of households that are owners
e. proportion that are first time buyers (net demand)
- 

Why? Look at where the population is growing: Millennials and Boomers
*(chart: mini multiples, line with nodes)*

But we know that headship is not the same as housing demand—not least because Boomers may have super high headship rates, but stay in their homes for a long time, and are not first time buyers.

There is a difference between "demanding one unit of housing" (stock) and "net demand" (flow) coming from first time buyers (Millennials)

Moving pieces: each age group's demand for housing is a function of 
	a. number of people in that age group
	b. proportion of those that form their own households
	c. proportion of households that are owners
	e. proportion that are first time buyers (net demand)

Eventually, Boomers will sell / gift their homes, but this won't be meaningful for another decade
*(chart: Silents, Old Boomers, Young Boomers moving into retirement housing very slowly)*

You can see this in recent years: since 2015 demand has come from higher income Millennials and retiring (low income) Boomers
*(chart: buyer since 2015 matrix)*

Even though Millennials are a huge generation, they may not lead into home ownership in the same way as Boomers, because of:
	a. affordability constraints (esp. because they are more city-living)
	b. declining headship rates
### What do they want? Smaller homes

Likely, smaller homes:
	For Millennials, a smaller home is a cheaper one
	For Boomers, also smaller: they are empty-nesters

### Where do they want to live?

Most still want to live in cities and suburbs of cities (ie, not very rural areas)
But what about remote work? (what does the research show?)
My hunch is that young people want to live in cities for the cultural amenities, not just work
Cities are a place to go out, eat good food, drink good coffee, date, and meet a life partner

But affordability is also an issue: this leads them to "second tier cities"—and the recent evidence shows that is indeed where they own more

And, in secondary cities:
	Millennials are over-represented in second-tier, cheaper cities
	Boomers are increasingly just following their kids

Evidence: demand has come from not just the rich, but middle-income households, too
These earn $75-125k, ie, enough to finance a home costing $750k (at 6%)
That means, a 3 bed in a less desirable neighborhood of a big city or a second-tier city ()

*(chart: violin chart depicting generations and how big their homes are)*
### What about immigrants?

Immigration is set to take over as the dominant driver of population growth
What is the propensity of immigrants to buy homes? Or do they mostly live in cities and rent?
Multigenerational housing?
