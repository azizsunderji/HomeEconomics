Three Themes from the NAR Generational Trends Report 2024

Contextual chart: Mortgages rates / existing home sales periods 

1 - The current market has vestiges of the new world (WFH etc), but it's a much more normal market now. Normalization post pandemic
- ~~Peak household formation cohorts (Millennials) reasserted themselves as buyers~~
- Distance between new home bought and prior residence back to normal (50 -> 20 miles)
- Some signs of the post pandemic hangover: urgent sales rose for young 

2 - Don't overestimate the effect of higher mortgage rates—people need homes. Effect of higher mortgage rates are surprisingly absent in the data:
- First time buyers rose, even as financing costs were higher
- % down / type of mortgage / difficulty obtaining / delays due to debt
- subtle signs: DTI a bigger concern. 
- income are higher (not clear how much due to generally higher incomes)
- Shift from renting to owning! (cf my work)

3 - Demographic change is happening but very slowly. Younger, more female, more brown—but owners still disproportionately white
- Small rise in GenZ, tiny rise in brown people
- That said, meaningful rise of single female buyer (cf. census)
- Maybe some easing of boomers v young fighting—GenZ buying old homes, older people moving into retirement communities
- is debt holding back youngs? (they are super educated now)
