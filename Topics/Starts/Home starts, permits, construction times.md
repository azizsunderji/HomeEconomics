Data
Permits By country, zip, etc—more granular than headline breakdown, [here](https://www.census.gov/construction/bps/msamonthly.html)
Amazing bulk download tool [here](https://www.census.gov/econ/currentdata/?programCode=RESCONST&startYear=1959&endYear=2024&categories%5B%5D=APERMITS&dataType=TOTAL&geoLevel=US&adjusted=1&notAdjusted=0&errorData=0)



Angles:

- divergence in starts: single family rising, multifamily falling
- permits show same thing
- pipeline of under-construction multifamily peaked and now declining
	- can link to longer construction times data will show
- architectural billings had foreshadowed declining multifamily starts

- Measures of starts and new home sales come from relatively small surveys and tend to be subject to noise from sampling variation and weather. **Rather than new home sales, I would actually recommend using single-family housing construction permits**, which come from a much larger sample and are less susceptible to weather-related distortions. For single-family housing, permits tend to lead starts by just one or two months, and you need not worry about builders abandoning their permits because doing so foregoes money and is exceptionally rare.

Jay Parsons argues that the Census data understates the decline in MF starts—it's actually much worse [here](https://x.com/jayparsons/status/1725528029093327048?s=20)

Brad Hargreaves argues the downturn in MF construction hasn't been so bad, and won't be [here](https://x.com/bhargreaves/status/1732792049781367075?s=20)

Bill McBride pretty downbeat [here](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/aziz.sunderji@gmail.com/#all/18e5711385d40a06): "The expected weakness in multi-family starts began last summer, and we should see ongoing weakness in the sector based on **less household formation, flat asking rents, rising vacancies, and tighter lending.** We saw this coming in the [National Multifamily Housing Council’s (NMHC’s) Quarterly Survey of Apartment Market Conditions](https://substack.com/redirect/2ebd960f-ef86-4494-a767-3a1bdadf43e1?j=eyJ1IjoiMWc1NTgifQ.4pGm_Hq4o5HyH9JHdXnFIn-nc-ca9MEjLyroCBPIiKo) and in the [Architectural Billings Index](https://substack.com/redirect/d1c5c5bf-e696-45fa-8a90-5a544dcee1cb?j=eyJ1IjoiMWc1NTgifQ.4pGm_Hq4o5HyH9JHdXnFIn-nc-ca9MEjLyroCBPIiKo) that showed a decline in multi-family design for the 18th consecutive month in January."

**Mar 19 Census Release: Housing Starts: 3 charts**

1. Record homes under construction
2. Huge rebound in single family starts, permits
	1. permits better measure (less weather-affected, larger sample, more smooth, no predictive power though)
3. Continuing weakness in multifamily
	1. Billings vs MF starts—neither doom nor gloom
	2. Review of doom mongers (Cap Econ) vs middle (Brad H) vs optimistic (Odetta)
4. Construction times hit a new high
