True in the housing market:

	they got cheap mortgages
	mortgages are not just more expensive but lending standards have tightened, too
	also: now a lack of supply, even if you can afford to buy
	rents adjust every year

Also true in the labor market:

	Job switcher premium has shrunk
	As layoffs eventually mount, seasoned workers have seniority (LIFO)
	
Broader point:

	Money illusion: even though incomes are higher, even outpacing inflation, people sense that they are worse off. They just look at prices.
	"People see prices going up and hate it. It's probably not as bad as they think, since inflation is high, and their wages are largely keeping up. But sometimes people aren't totally rational, and they just get bad vibes from higher prices. That probaby helps explain the surprisingly low level of consumer confidence despite a pretty solid economy"

Counterpoints:

	some of the pandemic bottlenecks have easedâ€”eg, easier to get a car now
