Multiple challenges:
	Seasonality
	Momentum
	Regional variation
	Historical cycles

3 charts:

1. Current sales compared to history (matched to comparable) -> same month sales over the years
2. + regional version of this chart
3. Current sales change from recent period + historical comparison (histogram? lines?) -> slanting lines, 3m, 6m
4. Recent path of sales, in this cycle, vs prior cycles (+ annotations) -> moving lines
