From housing economist Tom Lawler:

Yesterday the National Association of Realtors reported that it estimated that US existing home sales ran at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.79 million in October, a whopping 3.8% below my 3.94 million projection (which was about the same as consensus). The NAR’s estimate of unadjusted sales last month was 1.2% below my estimate, but the NAR’s implied seasonal factor October was a whopping 2.7% higher than I had estimated, and 5.15% higher than last October’s implied seasonal factor. While obviously this October had one more business day than last October, in the past this business day difference has translated into a smaller YOY increase in implied seasonal factors than that shown in today’s report. While the NAR’s seasonal factor for October to me seems too high, that’s why I missed and I’m sorry about that.

Census’ new [long-term US population projections](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023/population-projections.html) released last Friday were massively lower than the previous long-term projection released in 2017. In a [report earlier this week](https://calculatedrisk.substack.com/p/lawler-new-census-long-term-population) I highlighted the how the projected components of population change (births, deaths, and net international migration) differed in the two forecasts. Today I’m going to highlight a few “issues” with the latest projections over the next few years.

First, the “projected” components of change from July 1, 2022, to June 30, 2023, differ significantly from likely components of change based on existing information.

For deaths, the latest projection shows deaths from July 1, 2022, to June 30, 2023, of 2,861,510, a whopping 298,232 lower than CDC provisional data for that period show (this latter number will be revised upward slightly). In looking at deaths by age, mortality rates are “too low” in the latest long-term projection for almost all age groups, but especially for young to middle-aged adults.

For net international migration (NIM), the latest projection shows NIM from July 1, 2022, to June 30, 2023, of 853,220, or a sizeable 157,703 below the estimated NIM from July 1, 2021, to June 30, 2022, in the Vintage 2022 population estimates. Yet the admittedly limited data available on immigration trends suggest the NIM INCREASED from 2022 to 2023, and my best estimate in that NIM from July 1, 2022, to June 30, 2022, was about 1,200,000 – 346,780 higher than the assumption in the latest long-term population projection.

Finally, births in the latest long-term population projection from July 1, 2022, to June 30, 2023, are 18,788 below provisional CDC data for this period.

While the combination of under forecasting deaths, NIM, and births on net result in only a modest under-prediction of the total population for 2023, it also produces a materially different age distribution of the population. These differences, of course, impact projections of the age distribution of the population in subsequent years.

The “projected” age distribution of the US resident population in the latest long-term projections for July 1, 2023, also differs significantly from the July 1, 2023, projection in the Vintage 2022 estimates. (Each vintage estimate includes a projection for the subsequent year that is used, among other things, for employment estimates from the household survey).

Below is a table comparing the Vintage 2022 projection of the US resident population by age with the long-term population projection by age for July 1, 2023.

As this table shows, the latest long-term population projection assumes that there were significantly fewer children and teens, significantly fewer 30-54 year olds, and significantly more 55+ year olds on July 1, 2023, than is likely the case. These differences are a combination of different assumptions about births, deaths, and NIM, though it is difficult to separate out the latter two effects as the Vintage 2022 assumptions about deaths and NIM by single year of age are not disclosed.

These differences obviously affect the population projections by age for subsequent years.

I’ll have more on this topic later.

**CPS/ASEC Household Estimates “Show” Sharp Slowdown in Growth in 2023**

Newly released estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau’s annual America’s Families and Living Arrangements “show” that US household growth slowed sharply from March 2022 to March 2023 after surging in the previous year. I say “show” because each year’s estimates are based on the latest “vintage” estimates of the the US resident population by age, and there were substantial revisions in the age distribution of the population from “Vintage 2021” (used for the March 2022 household estimates) and “Vintage 2022” (used for the March 2023 household estimates). These estimates are based on the Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement, which has a larger sample than the monthly CPS.

Below is a table showing the CPS/ASEC household estimates by age for the past three years. Note that Census revised its estimates for March 2021 to incorporate Decennial Census results.

The table suggests that from March 2022 to March 2023 the number of US households increased by just 232,000, after surging by 1.958 million from March 2021 to March 2022.

As I noted above, however, there were significant revisions in the estimated age distribution of the US population in Vintage 2022 vs. Vintage 2021, and the 2021 household estimates would be different if Vintage 2022 estimates of the population were used – though by how much is difficult to say.

Here is a table from the report showing the estimated share of young adults living at home. From March 2021 to March 2022 the shares of both 18-24 year olds and 25-34 year olds living at home decreased sharply, but then increased significantly – though not back to 2021 levels – from March 2022 to March 2023. Not surprisingly, estimated headship rates for both age categories declined from 2022 to 2023 after increasing from 2021 to 2022.

I’ll have more on this topic later.

**CR Note on Household Formation:** The surge in household formation during the pandemic, and the recent subsequent slowdown in household formation is important for understanding overall housing demand. Here are some previous articles on Household Formation:
