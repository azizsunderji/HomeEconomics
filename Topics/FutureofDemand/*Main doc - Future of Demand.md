# The Future of Housing Demand

1. The pace of growth in the number of home owners has been remarkably steady since WW2
> during this time we've had wars, economics crises, and big swings in population growth rate

2. 3 factors that determine the number of new homeowners
   > population growth
   > headship rate
   > ownership rate

3. Factor 1: Population growth
>Immigration is rising, but too slowly to offset organic decline

4. Factor 2: Population aging
>People are moving into groups with higher headship rates, homeownership rates

5. Factor 3: Declining age-based headship, homeownership rates
>As GFC-scarred people age, their headship and HO% will fall short of prior generations at that same age

6. The slowdown would be much starker if it weren't for the aging of the population
>a. Headship and ownership both rise with age—especially in the "aging in place" times
>b. The aging of the population will naturally result in more home owners
>c. But this effect insufficient to balance the bigger effect of slowing population, scarring

7. Demand for homes will continue at the current pace until the end of the decade—then slow
>a. Household formation will remain at current levels, supported by 75+ year olds
>b. thereafter, population declines take over

> [!I know there will be temptation to show the change here, but I think this is more transparent, and we can reference the rates of change in the text, or add a line to show that...I like that this is a nice callback to the first chart]

8. What are the relative contributions? It's mostly the population effect
>a. Population growth—huge slowing
>b. marginal declines in headship, ownership rates
>![[Pasted image 20240422142712.png]]
9. What does this mean for prices?
>a. The demand for renting will expand, in % terms, much faster than for ownership
>b. Impact on home prices depends on the supply response
>c. Household formation is endogenous: if affordability improves, headship could rise
>d. Over the short run, home prices move more on economics (growth, rates) than demographics
>e. Over the long run, assuming no decline in the pace of building, slowing demand for homes—and stretched metrics (price:income, price:rent)—should lead to slower home price growth than in the past
