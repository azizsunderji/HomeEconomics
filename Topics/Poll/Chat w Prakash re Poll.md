Richard Koss - Columbia real estate program 

Private sector experienced / academic experience

NY-based (Phd in Penn, but been in real estate his whole life)

  

Teach in Prakash—online, on site, topic in macroeconomics and finance (1/2 housing, real estate)

Right now its on-site but thinking of migrating that online

Was thinking about offering that online, Jan 2025

Online courses are asynchronous 

(You record the material ahead of time, meet with them during office hours)

This is in his program (Hopkins MSc. Applied Economics, part of Arts and Sciences (Krieger school))

Maybe better talk to Richard

  

Prakash will send both syllabi for the one I guest lectured in 

  

Aziz could double dip—teach the monday class 6-9pm at business school repeat material on Tuesday morning in his own program

  

His program pays $10k per course (so half would be $5k)
