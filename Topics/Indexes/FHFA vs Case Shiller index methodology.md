As indicated in columns B to D, the initial three adjustments to the OFHEO model explain a substantial share of the overall gap between the indexes’ estimates. Implementation of the three changes shrinks the average absolute difference between the indexes’ price change estimates from 4.3 percent to 1.7 percent.

The first modeling adjustment entails removing **refinance appraisal** valuations from OFHEO’s estimation sample.

The next modeling adjustment involves changing the extent to which the model downweights valuation information from homes that have lengthy periods between valuations. The **downweighting** is performed by both OFHEO and S&P/Case-Shiller to increase the precision of index estimates.6 The S&P/Case-Shiller methodology materials suggest that its downweighting is far more modest, however. The S&P/Case-Shiller methodology primer notes that valuation pairs, which reflect the extent to which homes have appreciated or depreciated over a known time period, are given 20-45 percent less weight when the valuations occur ten years apart vis-àvis when they are only six months apart.7 By contrast, OFHEO’s downweighting tends to give ten-year pairs about 75 percent less weight than valuation pairs with a two-quarter interval.

The third of the three large-impact model adjustments entails incorporating **additional data** into the OFHEO estimation dataset. OFHEO’s standard estimation dataset includes only valuation data for homes that have secondary market financing from the Enterprises. Data from DataQuick Information Systems reflecting sales prices for homes with all types of financing are used to supplement the Enterprise data. These new data, like the S&P/Case-Shiller data, reflect selling prices recorded at county assessor and recorder offices. The underlying homes will include those with subprime loans, jumbo mortgages, VA, FHA and other types of financing arrangements.

Adding more low priced non-enterprise sales into the FHFA index also brought it more into line with CS (subprime)
