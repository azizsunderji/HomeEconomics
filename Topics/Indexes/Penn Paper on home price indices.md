Useful for [[Housing Market Rolls into Spring on a Weak Footing]]

The types of homes sold at different times may vary. Therefore changes in the reported index between times (seasons or even across years) may be due to the different composition of homes sold rather than reflecting real changes in the housing market. While it is possible to apply smoothing procedures to mitigate this issue; however, there are a few more criticisms of median indexes. New homes tend to be more expensive than equivalent older homes and it has been suggested that including these into the median index means that the price index will be biased upwards. Furthermore, all sales are treated as if they were single sales in a median price index. However, many homes sell multiple times in the time periodâ€“this information on repeat sales is ignored with a mean or median price index. Note that a mean house index is also subject to the same composition problem as the median index.
