- **There are two questions to be answered. Firstly, is zoning the impediment to building more? Secondly does more building lead to lower rents?**

- what do property developers and builders say about zoning restrictions? Do they say that it is indeed not a constraint on them building? And if they do say it's a constraint is that just because it's in their best interest to loosen zoning controls? 
- what do property developers and builders say about the huge stock of permitted but undeveloped land? Why is it sitting there fallow? Are they just landing and do they acknowledge doing that?
- you argue that builders and developers don't want more supply because that would lower prices and they would take a huge hit to their assets. But isn't there a world where the existing stock of land is owned by the same people who would be developing new housing and where the additional quantity and profitability of new housing outweigh the hit to asset values?
- is the analogy of rents being like government bonds a good one? In particular government bonds don't react to supply, they react to arbitrage between spot and future rates, which depend on monetary policy. Are rents similar, and that they are in arbitrage between housing and other assets? In other words, even if you add more supply, rents may not fall if interest rates remain high. In other words, it's interest rates in the economy which keep rents high, not the lack of supply.
